### List of all hosts file variants

The **Non GitHub mirror** is the link to use for some hosts file managers like @abstr_hyperlink that don't work with Github download links.

Host file recipe | Readme | Raw hosts | Unique domains | Non Github mirror \---------------- |:------:|:---------:|:--------------:|:-------------: Unified hosts = **(adware + malware)** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ fakenews** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ gambling** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ porn** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ social** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ fakenews + gambling** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ fakenews + porn** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ fakenews + social** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ gambling + porn** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ gambling + social** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ porn + social** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ fakenews + gambling + porn** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ fakenews + gambling + social** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ fakenews + porn + social** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ gambling + porn + social** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink Unified hosts **\+ fakenews + gambling + porn + social** | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_number , @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink 

**Expectation** : These unified hosts files should serve all devices, regardless of OS.

## Sources of hosts data unified in this variant

Updated `hosts` files from the following locations are always unified and included:

Host file source | Description | Home page | Raw hosts | Update frequency | License | Issues \-----------------|-------------|:---------:|:---------:|:----------------:|:-------:|:------: Steven Black's ad-hoc list | Additional sketch domains as I come across them. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | occasionally | MIT | @abstr_hyperlink Malware Domain List | Malware Domain List is a non-commercial community project. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | weekly | 'can be used for free by anyone' | @abstr_hyperlink add.Dead | Dead sites based on @abstr_hyperlink content. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | occasionally | GPLv @abstr_number + | @abstr_hyperlink add.Spam | Spam sites based on @abstr_hyperlink content. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | occasionally | GPLv @abstr_number + | @abstr_hyperlink Dan Pollock – @abstr_hyperlink | How to make the internet not suck (as much). | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | frequently | non-commercial with attribution | issues MVPS hosts file | The purpose of this site is to provide the user with a high quality custom HOSTS file. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | monthly | CC BY-NC-SA @abstr_number . @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink yoyo.org | Blocking with ad server and tracking server hostnames. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | frequently | | @abstr_hyperlink Mitchell Krog's - Badd Boyz Hosts | Sketchy domains and Bad Referrers from my Nginx and Apache Bad Bot and Spam Referrer Blockers | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | weekly | 'non-commercial with attribution' | @abstr_hyperlink CoinBlocker | Simple lists that can help prevent cryptomining in the browser or other applications | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | frequently | GPLv @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink UncheckyAds | Windows installers ads sources sites based on https://unchecky.com/ content. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | occasionally | | @abstr_hyperlink add. @abstr_number o @abstr_number Net | @abstr_number o @abstr_number Net tracking sites based on @abstr_hyperlink content. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | occasionally | GPLv @abstr_number + | @abstr_hyperlink KADhosts | Fraud/adware/scam websites. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | frequently | GPLv @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink AdAway | AdAway is an open source ad blocker for Android using the hosts file. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | occasionally | CC BY @abstr_number . @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink add.Risk | Risk content sites based on @abstr_hyperlink content. | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | occasionally | GPLv @abstr_number + | @abstr_hyperlink Tiuxo hostlist - ads | Categorized hosts files for DNS based content blocking | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | occasional | CC BY @abstr_number . @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink 

## Extensions

The unified hosts file is extensible. Extensions are used to block domains by category.

Extensions are optional, and are added to the base hosts file. Extensions are combined in various ways wth the default hosts file, and the combined products are stored in the @abstr_hyperlink folder.

For example, you may want to block porn domains in addition to the adware and malware we block by default. That hosts file is stored in the porn subfolder of the @abstr_hyperlink folder.

Data for extensions is stored in the @abstr_hyperlink folder. You manage extensions by curating the @abstr_hyperlink folder tree where you will find the data for `fakenews`, `social`, `gambling`, and `porn` extension data that we maintain and provide for you.

## Generate your own unified hosts file

To generate your own unified hosts file you will need Python @abstr_number . @abstr_number or later.

First install the dependencies with:
    
    
    pip @abstr_number  install --user -r requirements.txt
    

**Note** we recommend the `--user` flag which installs the required dependencies at the user level. More information about it can be found on pip @abstr_hyperlink .

To run unit tests, in the top level directory, just run:
    
    
    python @abstr_number  testUpdateHostsFile.py
    

The `updateHostsFile.py` script will generate a unified hosts file based on the sources in the local `data/` subfolder. The script will prompt you whether it should fetch updated versions (from locations defined by the `update.json` text file in each source's folder). Otherwise, it will use the `hosts` file that's already there.

### Usage

#### Using Python @abstr_number :
    
    
    python @abstr_number  updateHostsFile.py [--auto] [--replace] [--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn] [--extensions ext @abstr_number  ext @abstr_number  ext @abstr_number ]
    

#### Command line options:

`--help`, or `-h`: display help.

`--auto`, or `-a`: run the script without prompting. When `--auto` is invoked,

  * Hosts data sources, including extensions, are updated.
  * No extensions are included by default. Use the `--extensions` or `-e` flag to include any you want.
  * Your active hosts file is _not_ replaced unless you include the `--replace` flag.



`--backup`, or `-b`: Make a backup of existing hosts file(s) as you generate over them.

`--extensions <ext @abstr_number > <ext @abstr_number > <ext @abstr_number >`, or `-e <ext @abstr_number > <ext @abstr_number > <ext @abstr_number >`: the names of subfolders below the `extensions` folder containing additional category-specific hosts files to include in the amalgamation. Example: `--extensions porn` or `-e social porn`.

`--flush-dns-cache`, or `-f`: skip the prompt for flushing the DNS cache. Only active when `--replace` is also active.

`--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`, or `-i nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`: the IP address to use as the target. Default is `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`.

`--keepdomaincomments`, or `-k`: `true` (default) or `false`, keep the comments that appear on the same line as domains. The default is `true`.

`--noupdate`, or `-n`: skip fetching updates from hosts data sources.

`--output <subfolder>`, or `-o <subfolder>`: place the generated source file in a subfolder. If the subfolder does not exist, it will be created.

`--replace`, or `-r`: trigger replacing your active hosts

`--skipstatichosts`, or `-s`: `false` (default) or `true`, omit the standard section at the top, containing lines like `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number localhost`. This is useful for configuring proximate DNS services on the local network.

`--compress`, or `-c`: `false` (default) or `true`, _Compress_ the hosts file ignoring non-necessary lines (empty lines and comments) and putting multiple domains in each line. Reducing the number of lines of the hosts file improves the performances under Windows (with DNS Client service enabled).

`--minimise`, or `-m`: `false` (default) or `true`, like `--compress`, but puts each domain on a separate line. This is necessary because many implementations of URL blockers that rely on `hosts` files do not conform to the standard which allows multiple hosts on a single line.

## How do I control which sources are unified?

Add one or more _additional_ sources, each in a subfolder of the `data/` folder, and specify the `url` key in its `update.json` file.

Add one or more _optional_ extensions, which originate from subfolders of the `extensions/` folder. Again the url in `update.json` controls where this extension finds its updates.

Create an _optional_ `blacklist` file. The contents of this file (containing a listing of additional domains in `hosts` file format) are appended to the unified hosts file during the update process. A sample `blacklist` is included, and may be modified as you desire.

  * NOTE: The `blacklist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.



### How do I include my own custom domain mappings?

If you have custom hosts records, place them in file `myhosts`. The contents of this file are prepended to the unified hosts file during the update process.

The `myhosts` file is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I prevent domains from being included?

The domains you list in the `whitelist` file are excluded from the final hosts file.

The `whitelist` uses partial matching. Therefore if you whitelist `google-analytics.com`, that domain and all its subdomains won't be merged into the final hosts file.

The `whitelist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

## How can I contribute hosts records?

If you discover sketchy domains you feel should be included here, here are some ways to contribute them.

### Option @abstr_number : contact one of our hosts sources

The best way to get new domains included is to submit an issue to any of the data providers whose home pages are @abstr_hyperlink . This is best because once you submit new domains, they will be curated and updated by the dedicated folks who maintain these sources.

### Option @abstr_number : add your domains to Steven Black's personal data file

Fork this hosts this repo and add your links to @abstr_hyperlink .

Then, submit a pull request.

**WARNING** : this is less desirable than Option @abstr_number because the ongoing curation falls on us and what you've just done is created more work for us.

### Option @abstr_number : create your own hosts list as a repo on Github

If you're able to curate your own collection of sketchy domains, then curate your own hosts list. Then signal the existence of your repo as @abstr_hyperlink and we may include your new repo into the collection of sources we pull whenever we create new versions.

## What is a hosts file?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`. Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware, and other irritants.

For example, to nullify requests to some doubleclick.net servers, adding these lines to your hosts file will do it:
    
    
    # block doubleClick's servers
     @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number  ad.ae.doubleclick.net
     @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number  ad.ar.doubleclick.net
     @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number  ad.at.doubleclick.net
     @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number  ad.au.doubleclick.net
     @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number  ad.be.doubleclick.net
    # etc...
    

## We recommend using `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number` instead of `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`

Traditionally most host files use `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`, the _loopback address_ , to establish an IP connection to the local machine.

We prefer to use `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`, which is defined as a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown, or non applicable target.

Using `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number` is empirically faster, possibly because there's no wait for a timeout resolution. It also does not interfere with a web server that may be running on the local PC.

## Why not use just `@abstr_number` instead of `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number`?

We tried that. Using `@abstr_number` doesn't work universally.

## Location of your hosts file

To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text editor.

**Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Linux** : `/etc/hosts` file.

**Windows** : `%SystemRoot%\system @abstr_number \drivers\etc\hosts` file.

## Updating hosts file on Windows

On Linux and Mac OS X, you can simply run the Python script, but on Windows, more work is required due to compatibility issues in implementing some of the functionality for Windows. It is preferable to run the batch file as follows:

@abstr_code_section 

This file MUST be run in command prompt with administrator privileges in the repository directory. In addition to updating the hosts file, it can also replace the existing hosts file, and reload the DNS cache. It goes without saying that in order for this to work, you must be connected to the internet.

To open a command prompt as administrator in the repository's directory, do the following:

**Windows XP** : Start -> Run -> `cmd`

_*Windows Vista, @abstr_number *_ : Start Button -> type `cmd` -> right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as Administrator"

_*Windows @abstr_number *_ : Start -> Swipe Up -> All Apps -> Windows System -> right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as Administrator"

_*Windows @abstr_number *_ : Start Button -> type `cmd` -> right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as Administrator"

You can also refer to the "Third-Party Hosts Managers" section for further recommended solutions from third parties.

## Reloading hosts file

Your operating system will cache DNS lookups. You can either reboot or run the following commands to manually flush your DNS cache once the new hosts file is in place.

| The Google Chrome browser may require manually cleaning up its DNS Cache on `chrome://net-internals/#dns` page to thereafter see the changes in your hosts file. See: https://superuser.com/questions/ @abstr_number :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Windows

Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run this command:

@abstr_code_section 

|If you want to use a huge hosts file by merging @abstr_hyperlink (NOT INCLUDED HERE) you need to DISABLE and STOP `Dnscache` service before you replace hosts file in Windows Systems. You have been warned.| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before flushing the DNS cache, open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run this command:

@abstr_code_section 

### Linux

Open a Terminal and run with root privileges:

**Debian/Ubuntu** `sudo service network-manager restart`

**Linux Mint** `sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start`

**Linux with systemd** : `sudo systemctl restart network.service`

**Fedora Linux** : `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`

**Arch Linux/Manjaro with Network Manager** : `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`

**Arch Linux/Manjaro with Wicd** : `sudo systemctl restart wicd.service`

**RHEL/Centos** : `sudo /etc/init.d/network restart`

**FreeBSD** : `sudo service nscd restart`

To enable the `nscd` daemon initially, it is recommended that you run the following commands:

@abstr_code_section 

Then modify the `hosts` line in your `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file to the following:

@abstr_code_section 

**Others** : Consult @abstr_hyperlink .

### Mac OS X

Open a Terminal and run: @abstr_code_section 

## Release management

This repository uses @abstr_hyperlink , an excellent CLI release tool for Github repos and npm packages, to automate creating @abstr_hyperlink . This is why the @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink files are bundled.

## Goals of this unified hosts file

The goals of this repo are to:

@abstr_number . automatically combine high-quality lists of hosts,

@abstr_number . provide easy extensions,

@abstr_number . de-dupe the resultant combined list,

@abstr_number . and keep the resultant file reasonably sized.

A high-quality source is defined here as one that is actively curated. A hosts source should be frequently updated by its maintainers with both additions and removals. The larger the hosts file, the higher the level of curation is expected.

For example, the (huge) hosts file from @abstr_hyperlink is **not** included here because it is very large ( @abstr_number , @abstr_number + entries) and doesn't currently display a corresponding high level of curation activity.

It is expected that this unified hosts file will serve both desktop and mobile devices under a variety of operating systems.

## Third-Party Hosts Managers

  * @abstr_hyperlink (for Windows): The Unified Hosts AutUpdate package is purpose-built for this unified hosts project as well as in active development by community members. It's sophisticated enough to allow any novice the ability to install and uninstall the blacklist of their choosing to their local hosts file and keep it automatically up to date, while also being minimal enough to be able to be easily placed in a shared network location and deployed across an organization via group policies. And since it is in active development by community members, your bug reports, feature requests, and other feedback are most welcome.

  * @abstr_hyperlink is a Visual Hosts file Manager, written in Java, by Christian Martínez. Check it out!




## Interesting Applications

  * @abstr_hyperlink is a network-wide DHCP server and ad blocker that runs on @abstr_hyperlink . Pi-hole uses this repository as one of its sources. This is a very interesting project to setup yourself, or you can @abstr_hyperlink .

  * @abstr_hyperlink (for Debian, Raspbian & Ubuntu): Set up a local DNS server with a `/etc/bind/named.conf.blocked` file, sourced from here.

  * @abstr_hyperlink (for BSD, Windows & Linux): Set up a blacklist for everyone on your network using the power of the unified hosts reformatted for DualServer. And if you're on Windows, this project also maintains an update script to make updating DualServer's blacklist even easier.

  * @abstr_hyperlink – @abstr_hyperlink is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver.

  * @abstr_hyperlink This github gist has a short shell script (bash, will work on any 'nix) and uses 'wget' & 'awk' present in most distros, to fetch a specified hosts file and convert it the format required by dnsmasq. Supports ipv @abstr_number and ipv @abstr_number . Designed to be used as either a shell script, or can be dropped into /etc/cron.weekly (or wherever suits). Script is short and easily edited, also has a short document attached with notes on dnsmasq setup.
