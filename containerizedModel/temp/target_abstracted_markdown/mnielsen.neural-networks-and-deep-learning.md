# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains code samples for my book on @abstr_hyperlink .

The code is written for Python @abstr_number . @abstr_number or @abstr_number . @abstr_number . Michal Daniel Dobrzanski has a repository for Python @abstr_number @abstr_hyperlink . I will not be updating the current repository for Python @abstr_number compatibility.

The program `src/network @abstr_number .py` uses version @abstr_number . @abstr_number or @abstr_number . @abstr_number of the Theano library. It needs modification for compatibility with later versions of the library. I will not be making such modifications.

As the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add new features. However, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel free to fork and modify the code.
